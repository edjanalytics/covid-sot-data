# Covid Source of Truth Data for the Louisville Metro Area

This is a public resource created to host a source of truth data set and accompanying visualizations related to the Covid-19 pandemic for the Louisville community. The idea is to use data transparency to achieve greater public and situational awareness of the Covid-19 pandemic. 

One of the unique features of this public repository is that it looks at the Louisville Metropolitan Statistical Area, a ten-county region. People travel for work, recreation, consumer services, health and other purposes to and from Jefferson County from and to the surrounding counties, and information accumulated across the region is meaningful. 

The posts are updated each day on weekdays, with a target posting time of 1 p.m. Louisville local time. The data sources and methods are described the daily .pdf document See, for example, "LouisvilleMetro_Covid-19_Charts_August72020.pdf." Data visualizations are accumulated in this PDF. Data visualizations are provided individually as .jpegs for the ease of embedding. For transparency, the source data file for the visualizations is also published each weekday. See, for example, "LouisvilleMetro_Covid-19_Data_August72020.xlsx."

A professional data science team from EdjAnalytics volunteered to create and maintain the ETL and data accumulation processes. A network of public health experts, medical doctors, epidemiologists, scientists and others have peer reviewed the visualizations. We welcome usage of these materials and any questions.
